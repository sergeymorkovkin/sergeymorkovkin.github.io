Millions of individuals and businesses alike use Skype to make free video and voice calls. Skype also allows to send instant messages and share files with other people.</p><p>While working at Skype headquarters, I was improving their advertising rotation app as well as underlying infrastructure. Skype client used the Internet Explorer container to show ads. Since the version of IE varied from client to client, Skype faced multiple issues including memory leaks and excessive resource consumption. I helped optimize Skype’s ad rotation app, which resolved all of the known issues. In addition, I created complete test coverage of the system, which included both unit and functional tests. This eliminated the human factor of mistakes on deployment.</p><p>Moreover, I worked on Skype’s ad error analytics. Issues from clients were streamed to Hadoop cluster. Retrieving data from cluster required to write complex SQL queries, which sometimes took hours to execute. I was able to create a simple, yet powerful analytics panel. Since then, everyone on the team had instant access to real-time error reports. This required no SQL knowledge and the results were shown as comprehensive interactive charts. I’ve also worked on Skype’s chat bots, handling over 50,000 simultaneous users and created a few R&D prototypes.</p><p>My solution reduced the team reaction time significantly, which had a direct positive impact on business.</p><p>After my contract had come to an end, I went back home.</p></div><div class="col-12"><span class="line">Related reviews:</span><ul class="related-reviews"><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-8"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">In the short period of 6 months Sergey achieved a lot on his Job at Skype-Microsoft.

The company provides its services through an online teletherapy platform.</p><p>I worked for Presence Learning as a Technical Lead and Project Manager. My responsibility included negotiations with customer teams, technology consulting, and leading a team of 10 developers.</p><p>The project started with a business trip to San Francisco, where two other developers and I went to meet the customer. From the very start we gained respect for our technical expertise and were entrusted with the development of new functionalities.</p><p>Presence Learning teletherapy rooms represented a virtual class with audio/video chat and an interactive whiteboard that synced in real-time between all students. Our work consisted of developing new game activities for these rooms. Some of game activities we introduced were flashcards, memory games, “guess who” games, and so on.</p><p>Over the course of the year we had built 10 major features over 13 successful product releases, all of which were delivered on time. Everything we created had full functional test coverage. We’ve also made multiple improvements on all aspects of the project such as application performance, architecture and development workflow.</p><p>In a short period of one year we had turned MVP into a fully functional product. Both the customer team and their clients gave exceptionally positive and warm feedback.</p></div><div class="col-12"><span class="line">Related reviews:</span><ul class="related-reviews"><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-5"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">Thanks to Sergey's technical and project leadership, Sergey and team built 10 major features over 13 successful product releases.</p><a class="text-more" href="javascript:openReview(5)">Read more</a> <span class="name blockquote-footer">Manu Lohiya</span></div></li><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-4"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">Over the year we worked together, I developed a deep respect for Sergey for his attention to detail (all the way down to the pixel level) and the way he kept his team organized and on task.</p><a class="text-more" href="javascript:openReview(4)">Read more</a> <span class="name blockquote-footer">Christine Shellenbarger</span></div></li></ul></div></div></div><!-- 3: Profusa --><div class="carousel-item"><div class="info row"><div class="project-logo col-12 col-lg-4"><div class="logo logo-3"></div></div><div class="project-tech col-12 col-lg-8"><div class="tag-cloud"><span class="item">JS</span> <span class="item">HTML5</span> <span class="item">CSS3</span> <span class="item">Angular 2.x</span></div></div></div><div class="main row"><div class="col-12"><div class="summary"><dl><dt>Position</dt><dd>Technical Lead</dd><dt>Started</dt><dd>August 2017</dd><dt>Duration</dt><dd>4 month</dd></dl></div><p>Profusa is a company, creating tissue-integrating biosensors for continuous contactless monitoring of blood chemistries. Some of the beneficiaries of Profusa include athletes, soldiers, and diabetics. Medical institutions are also using Profusa sensors for live monitoring the oxygen and sugar levels.</p><p>In order to fine-tune sensors during development, Profusa needed a system for real-time data collection, analysis, and consolidation. Their legacy system was not adequate to handle the task, so my team and I took charge of their legacy system modernization.</p><p>I was a Manager and a Team Lead for this project. Having started with only 3 people on the team, I was able to made thorough analysis of all issues that affected system performance and stability.</p><p>The challenge was to collect data from multiple sources like Bluetooth sensors, USB Sensors, and CSV-files. Since every source had it’s own data structure, the first thing we had to implement was a data consolidation algorithm. As a result, no matter the input source, all of the data had been converted to a single internal format. This significantly reduced code duplication and improved maintainability.</p><p>Performance and stability of chart rendering was another issue we had addressed. On large data sets, the chart was freezing, while on medium data sets, it would take a number of minutes for the chart to display. Benchmark clearly showed the problem existed on multiple levels. We had replaced the charting component, enabled the network traffic compression, and completely reworked the data pre-processing algorithms. This increased chart display speed by 40 times and resolved all known stability issues.</p><p>After the code and performance issues were addressed, we switched to developing the new features. We created a convenient web interface for importing data files, which supported multi-file uploads, had progress indication, and drag-n-drop support. This allowed anybody on the customer team to import arbitrary data generated by 3rd party software. Unfortunately, some of the improvements were not possible to implement in the scope of the existing architecture and technology stack. Therefore, we agreed to make a short proof of concept project intended to demonstrate future possibilities and become the base for the future versions.</p><p>The prototype we’ve created had a significantly faster data streaming based on Web Sockets, dynamic buffering to handle temporary disconnections, and supported pivoting displays for displaying charts in a stack.</p><p>We were able to finish our work before the due date, so we spent the remaining time writing a technical documentation, improving development infrastructure, and setting continuous delivery / integration.</p><p>Project has been successfully delivered and the client was very happy with the work we had done.</p></div><div class="col-12"><span class="line">Related reviews:</span><ul class="related-reviews"><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-2"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">Sergey is a very talented developer with a vast knowledge of all digital/web areas and the latest technology trends.</p><a class="text-more" href="javascript:openReview(2)">Read more</a> <span class="name blockquote-footer">Nicolas Mercier</span></div></li><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-3"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">Sergey is a true team player who jumps in when needed and promotes his team equally to challenge themselves.</p><a class="text-more" href="javascript:openReview(3)">Read more</a> <span class="name blockquote-footer">Ted Girata</span></div></li></ul></div></div></div><!-- 4: Twilio --><div class="carousel-item"><div class="info row"><div class="project-logo col-12 col-lg-4"><div class="logo logo-4"></div></div><div class="project-tech col-12 col-lg-8"><div class="tag-cloud"><span class="item">JS</span> <span class="item">HTML5</span> <span class="item">CSS3</span> <span class="item">React</span> <span class="item">Python</span></div></div></div><div class="main row"><div class="col-12"><div class="summary"><dl><dt>Position</dt><dd>Crisis Manager</dd><dt>Started</dt><dd>November 2016</dd><dt>Duration</dt><dd>2 month</dd></dl></div><p>Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service (PaaS) company based in San Francisco, California. Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.</p><p>This example is about one of the most challenging projects I’ve had in my experience. Stress is a test of character and resolve. While under a lot of stress we still have to deal with the situation with a cool, calm, and collective spirit. That is easier said than done.</p><p>In order to better control service interruptions, Twilio started the development of internal infrastructure issue tracking, stability reporting, and emergency notifications custom incident tracking system. The said development project had deadlines that were demanding, stressful, difficult to meet to say the least. Three weeks before the due date, the Team Lead could not stand the stress, so he quit the company and left a very angry customer behind.</p><p>I took this situation as an opportunity to enhance my skills and took charge for this project as the Crisis Manager. The company contracted to this project could not afford to fail this project for a number of reasons and delegated all free resources to this task. As a result, I had 11 people assigned to my team.</p><p>After making an analysis of the situation, it became clear we would not be able to deliver on time. The project code was clogged, there was unpredictable regression, and a discouraged team.</p><p>I’ve scheduled a conference call with the client. On the call I had introduced myself and informed the client on the situation. we also needed to discuss a new delivery plan, with a shift in the deadlines. Needless to say, the client was furious, to put it lightly. When common sense prevailed over the many expressed emotions, we came to an agreement about deploying partial functionality in 4 weeks, and extended the final delivery by one month. The next day I had met with the project team and informed them on the good news. The team looked inspired and continued their work.</p><p>I had set issue tracking and estimated the remaining work. Since then I was sending daily reports on progress to the client. This positively influenced our relationship. I had also been delegating tasks to team members with consideration to individual strengths, running as many parallel tasks as possible.</p><p>As a result of our coordinated teamwork, the project has been successfully delivered and the conflict was resolved.</p></div><div class="col-12"><span class="line">Related reviews:</span><ul class="related-reviews"><li class="item"><div class="side"><div class="photo face face-1"></div></div><div class="main blockquote"><p class="quote">I can say that Sergey is extremely smart, highly technical, professional, and a friendly person.

It is owned by Softonic International. It reaches over 100 million users per month. Softonic’s private network had dozens of services with an unrestricted access to each other, and needed an authorization system to resolve this problem.</p><p>My team and I chose to base the solution on OAuth 2.0 specification. It was a known standard that matched our goals perfectly, but didn’t address high-load issues. No physical server would stand authenticating all request in the network.</p><p>In order to resolve this problem I proposed to use asymmetric cryptography tokens with caching and timestamp-based invalidation. This idea appeared to be the best solution and had received approval by the client.</p><p>Having a few hundred total endpoints, Softonic needed a method for managing permissions. I had created a convenient admin panel for managing access control lists (ACLs). The panel included permission management and import/export utility.</p><p>After two months of development, the project had been successfully handed over on time.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><ul class="pagination"><li class="page-item"><a class="page-link slide-prev" href="javascript:void(0);"><i class="icon icon-chevron-left"></i></a></li><li class="page-item"><b class="page-info"><span class="page-number">1</span> of <span class="page-count">0</span></b></li><li class="page-item"><a class="page-link slide-next" href="javascript:void(0);"><i class="icon icon-chevron-right"></i></a></li></ul></div>

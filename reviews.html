              <p>I worked with Sergey for about 2.5 years and all that time managed him directly. I can say that Sergey is extremely smart, highly technical, professional, and a friendly person. He is a strong and professional team lead. He was leading several important projects in Lohika and all of them were successful. Sergey always learns something new, he is eager to get new knowledge. He always listens to what his manager says and, even more important, always hears what his manager recommends and acts according to what's been agreed.</p>
              <p>Sergey is very proactive and during this time I got many new ideas from Sergey regarding processes, people and clients, that were successfully implemented. From a technical perspective, Sergey is a software developer of an architect level. Frequently his architectural recommendations were accepted by clients that allowed to significantly improve products quality, stability and performance.</p>
              <p>In addition, Sergey has very good presentation skills and great English. He is able to perform good technical presentation on any topic to any audience. He knows what to highlight, when and how, how to answer tough questions and how to attract audience to his point of view. In general I can say that Sergey is a really professional lead developer who positively impacts any organization, project and process that he works on.</p>

              <p>Sergey is a very talented developer with a vast knowledge of all digital/web areas and the latest technology trends.</p>
              <p>Working with Sergey on any project makes the job of a PM 10x easier. He provides frequent updates on his status and next steps and I always felt confident that he would meet due dates and still have time leftover for the unexpected. He clearly outlines what he needs to do his job, but doesn't let outstanding items stop him from doing what he can.</p>
              <p>He brings a lot of experience across a wide range of leading edge technologies. He is approachable, listens and always strives to produce a solution that satisfies all parties involved - a solid team player who goes beyond to make it happen. I highly recommend Sergey as his attitude and commitment always contributed positively to the success of the project we worked on together.</p>

              <p>Sergey is a true team player who jumps in when needed and promotes his team equally to challenge themselves. He also is a very savvy technologist who researches different aspects of the problems at hand and applies his experience and mastery of technology to meet the customers demands.</p>

              <p>It was a pleasure to work with Sergey while he worked with Presence Learning as both a Technical Lead and Project Manager. Over the year we worked together, I developed a deep respect for Sergey for his attention to detail (all the way down to the pixel level) and the way he kept his team organized and on task.</p>
              <p>He is an excellent communicator and, as the product designer, I found it very valuable to bounce ideas off of him as he always kept the end-user in mind. In addition, Sergey has an invaluable passion for his craft which shows in the work he has done at Presence Learning as well as in his spare time. I would leap at the opportunity to work with Sergey again.</p>

              <p>Thanks to Sergey's technical and project leadership, Sergey and team built 10 major features over 13 successful product releases. Additionally, Sergey was also proactive about suggesting improvements to features and processes which further helped us strengthen our process for the long haul.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, our customers loved the features and as the product owner, I was satisfied. Would be an honor to work with Sergey again in the future!</p>
